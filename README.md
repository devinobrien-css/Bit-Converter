# Bit-Converter
The producer.c code takes in a .txt file, converts it to binary and prints it to a file. The consumer.c code takes this binary file and converts it back into characters. To run your own tests for this project, create a .txt file named input.txt and add your text to be converted. So long as the .txt file is in the same package as the C files, the code will compile and run.
